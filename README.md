## About The Project

With this app you can import/export photos and videos from/to photo gallery and also download files directly from the web. 

Files managed by the app are kept within app's folder therefore they are not exposed to phone's built-in file manager unless the phone is rooted.

Here are some other features:

* A simple built-in web browser
* Transfer files from your PC through web sockets. (Socket app repo => https://github.com/martymfly/file-transfer-expo)
* Darkmode - Lightmode
* Passcode protection
* Unlock with biometrics
